Each plot program assigns both a working directory and a file locatiion for the data file.

As you may not be using windows and most defenitly do not have the same structure on your machine as I do 
these will need to be changed.

Simply replace my working directory with the location you wish the charts to print to and the file location
to where you have stored the unzipped data file for this project.
